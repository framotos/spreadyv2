# General rules

- before making changes to the backend structure, always ask for confirmation
- before suggesting changes, check the global structure of the project and where certain objects are used. If your planned changes are conflicting the existing structure, ask what to do
- Suggest solutions that I didn’t think about—anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert

# project structure

- All API call / fetching / posting related functions shall be stored in the [api.ts](mdc:app/frontend/src/lib/api.ts) file
- all custom hooks are stored in the "hooks" folder
- main backend file is [debug_main.py](mdc:app/backend/debug_main.py)
